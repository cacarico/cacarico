## About me

Hello, I'm Caio :D 

I've been working with IT since the past 10 years, during this time I've migrated over 30 companies to cloud and helped build Cloud Native architectures for all kind of companies.

Most of the time I'm customizing my Arch Linux and playing around with NeoVim. You can checkout my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/cacarico/dotfiles) if you, like me, is crazy for fancy looking terminals.  
If I'm not in the computer you can easily find me at Apex Legends, I'm a casual player trying my lucky solo queuing and hoping to get Masters one day.

I have a love and hate ralationship with Istio and Kubernetes, and as more as I study more I realize it is not enough.
