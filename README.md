## About me

Hello, I'm Caio :D 

Most days you’ll find me tweaking my Arch Linux setup or diving deep into NeoVim configs. If you’re into that kind of thing (fancy terminals, custom scripts, questionable life choices), feel free to check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/cacarico/dotfiles).

I have a love-hate relationship with Kubernetes and Istio — the more I learn, the more I realize how much more there is to learn (and complain about). But hey, that’s half the fun.

When I’m not neck-deep in Lua or debugging something that shouldn’t be broken, I enjoy hacking on open source projects, exploring new tech, and occasionally building things nobody asked for.
